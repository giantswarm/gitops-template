# Add a new Workload Cluster template

Workload Cluster templates are pre-configured cluster templates that you can use to easily create a cluster instance.

Depending on the infrastructure provider and release you want to use to create your new cluster, you might need either
a [Vintage cluster template](./add_wc_template_vintage.md) or the new
[CAPI based cluster template](./add_wc_template_capi.md). Please check these docs about how to add a template in each
of the cases.

If the template you need already exists, you can skip this step and continue to the recommended next steps:

- [Add a new Workload Cluster repository structure](./add_wc_structure.md)
- [Add Workload Cluster instance](./add_wc_instance.md)
