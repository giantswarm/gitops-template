# Add workload cluster instance

At Giant Swarm, we're currently offering two types of cluster management APIs: vintage and CAPI (CAPx). Depending on
which provider you're using, you have to choose a correct [cluster template](./add_wc_template.md) already. To proceed
with this step, you also need to have [workload cluster structure](./add_wc_structure.md) prepared. Then, depending
on your provider continue to either:

- [vintage cluster infrastructure creation](./add_wc_instance_vintage.md)
- [CAPx cluster infrastructure creation](./add_wc_instance_capi.md)
